We are in a consequential shift in design as it relates to human-computer
interaction. Design, at its core, has never been primarily about creating
objects; it is fundamentally about solving problems. Aesthetic and functional
forms and patterns—be they visual, cognitive, or tangible—are the product of
problem solving. One of the most formidable problems that we will face when
designing user interfaces in the emerging paradigm of ubiquitous computing, is
how to manage the limited bandwidth of user attention.

This talk will address the need to extrapolate new models and metaphors of
interaction in order to manage the burgeoning volume of features and signals in
the software that mediates so much of our lives. In this world, user interfaces
must become more transparent and unobtrusive. This means that they will need to
do more than simply present features and information, they will also need to be
able to know when to hide these things from us as well. Interfaces will have to
be designed to proactively think ahead of us, and anticipate what we need
before we need it.
